One of my favorite courses in computer science is Algorithm Design and Analysis. This course has significantly deepened my understanding of fundamental algorithms and their analysis. We started with sorting problems to introduce the divide-and-conquer strategy and heap data structures. As the course progressed, we delved[delvd] into more advanced data structures like disjoint sets, red-black trees, and hash tables. Later, we combined these concepts with graph theory to explain common algorithms such as minimum spanning trees. The course also covered greedy algorithms and dynamic programming, providing a comprehensive overview of essential algorithmic strategies.

In class, this theoretical[ˌθiəˈretɪk(ə)l] foundation helped me grasp the complexities of various algorithms. We also solved problems on online judges, which improved my coding and problem-solving skills.

Outside of class, I have been very active in self-study and competitions. Since my freshman year, I have been solving problems on LeetCode and participating in weekly contests. This has greatly enhanced my algorithm skills. From my junior year, I delved deeper into competitive programming and participated in various contests. Such as scoring in the top 1.33%（*one point three three percent*） in the CCF-CSP Certification exam and winning a gold medal in the Nanjing University Programming Contest. These experiences have solidified[səˈlɪdɪˌfaɪ] my interest and skills in algorithm.
