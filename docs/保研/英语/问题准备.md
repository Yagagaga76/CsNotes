### 自我介绍
Hi, my name is Tian Haodong, and I'm a student at Nanjing University, majoring in Computer Science and Finance. I enjoy learning new things and sharing my notes on my blog. I've kept good grades, ranking 3rd in my class, and I've won the Excellence Scholarship for two years in a row.

I've worked on many projects and joined several competitions. For example, I led a team in the Nanjing University-NetEase Game Competition, where we made an RTS game using C# and Unity. This made me very interested in the game industry and computer graphics.

I'm also good at data structures and algorithms. I won a gold medal[ˈmed(ə)l] in the Nanjing University Programming Contest and scored in the top 1.33% in the CCF-CSP exam. I taught myself computer graphics and completed projects like a rasterizer[ˈræs.tə.raɪz] and a simple ray tracer, which helped me understand graphics better.

I'm very interested in real-time rendering and hope to contribute to improving visuals and performance in future games or AR applications. I look forward to continuing my studies and growing in this field.
### 介绍家乡
I'm from Shenyang, the capital city of Liaoning Province in northeastern China. Shenyang is a city with a long history and lots of culture. It's famous for being the birthplace of the Qing Dynasty. You can visit the Shenyang Imperial[ɪmˈpɪriəl] Palace, which is a really cool historic site.

Shenyang is also a big industrial[ɪnˈdʌstriəl] city, known for its car and airplane factories. But it's not all factories  we have beautiful parks like Beiling Park and the Botanical[bəˈtænɪk(ə)l] Garden where people can relax and enjoy nature.

One of my favorite things about Shenyang is the food. We have amazing local dishes, like Shenyang dumplings and Laobian dumplings. The street food is also great, with lots of tasty snacks to try. One of the most famous street foods is "chicken rack" (鸡架), which is very popular among locals. 

Shenyang is a place where you can see both old traditions and modern life. It's a great city with a lot to offer, and I'm proud to call it my hometown.
### 最喜欢的课程
One of my favorite courses in computer science is Algorithm Design and Analysis. This course has significantly deepened my understanding of fundamental algorithms and their analysis. We started with sorting problems to introduce the divide-and-conquer strategy and heap data structures. As the course progressed, we delved[delvd] into more advanced data structures like disjoint sets, red-black trees, and hash tables. Later, we combined these concepts with graph theory to explain common algorithms such as minimum spanning trees. The course also covered greedy algorithms and dynamic programming, providing a comprehensive overview of essential algorithmic strategies.

In class, this theoretical[ˌθiəˈretɪk(ə)l] foundation helped me grasp the complexities of various algorithms. We also solved problems on online judges, which improved my coding and problem-solving skills.

Outside of class, I have been very active in self-study and competitions. Since my freshman year, I have been solving problems on LeetCode and participating in weekly contests. This has greatly enhanced my algorithm skills. From my junior year, I delved deeper into competitive programming and participated in various contests. Such as scoring in the top 1.33%（*one point three three percent*） in the CCF-CSP Certification exam and winning a gold medal in the Nanjing University Programming Contest. These experiences have solidified[səˈlɪdɪˌfaɪ] my interest and skills in algorithm.
