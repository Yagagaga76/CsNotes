## 算法与数据结构
### 二叉搜索树
A Binary Search Tree is a type of binary tree. The key rule is that the left child has a smaller value, and the right child has a larger value. 
1. Searching start at the root, compare the value, and move left or right accordingly until find the value or reach a leaf. 
2. Inserting works the same way, and place the new value where find a suitable spot. (at leaves)
3. Deletion involves replacing the node with its in-order successor[səkˈsesər] if it has two children.
### 快速排序
Quicksort is a fast sorting algorithm. 
1. First selecting a "pivot[ˈpɪvət]" element from the array and then rearranging[ˌriəˈreɪndʒ] the other elements into two groups: those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. 
2. The pivot is then in its final position. This process is repeated for the two groups, recursively sorting the sub-arrays.
### 冒泡排序
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
1. It repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent[əˈdʒeɪs(ə)nt] items, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 
2.  Then start again from the beginning and repeat the process until no swaps are needed, meaning the list is sorted. 
### 归并排序
Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer approach . 
1. First, divide the list into smaller sublists until each sublist has only one item. 
2. Then, it repeatedly merges these sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sorted list remaining. 
3. The main steps are to split the list into halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves together. 
### 希尔排序
Shell Sort is an advanced version of insertion sort that improves efficiency by comparing and sorting elements that are far apart. By starting with larger gaps, Shell Sort moves elements closer to their final position faster,.
1. It starts by sorting elements with a large gap between them, then progressively[prəʊˈɡresɪvli] reduces the gap and sorts the elements again. 
2. This process continues until the gap is 1, at which point it performs a final insertion sort. 
### 选择排序
Selection Sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted part and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
1. Start with the first element as the current minimum.
2. Scan the remaining unsorted portion of the list to find the smallest element.
3. Swap the smallest element found with the first unsorted element.
4. Then move to next element and repeat

### 插入排序
Insertion Sort repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position among the previously sorted elements.
1. Start with the second element, considering the first element as a sorted sublist.
2. Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted sublist.
3. Shift all elements in the sorted sublist that are greater than the current element one position to the right.
4. Insert the current element into its correct position.
5. Move to the next element and repeat
### kruskal
Kruskal's algorithm is a method used to find the minimum spanning tree. The MST is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight and no cycles.
1. Sort all edges in the graph by their weight in ascending order.
2. Iterate through the sorted edges, adding each edge to the MST if it doesn't form a cycle with the edges already in the MST.
3. Continue this process until the MST contains exactly 𝑛−1 edges
### prim
Prim's algorithm is a method used to find the minimum spanning tree.
1. Start with a single vertex and consider it as part of the MST.
2. Find the smallest edge connecting a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
3. Add this edge and the vertex to the MST.
4. Repeat until all vertices are included in the MST.
### Dijkstra
Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices.
1. Initialize the distance to the source vertex as 0 and to all other vertices as infinity.Set the source vertex as the current vertex and mark it as visited.
2. For the current vertex, update the distances to its adjacent vertices. If a shorter path is found, update the distance.
3. Select the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance as the new current vertex.
4. Repeat until all vertices are visited or the smallest distance among the unvisited vertices is infinity.
### bellman-ford
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices. It can handle graphs with negative edge weights.
1. Initialize the distance to the source vertex as 0 and the distance to all other vertices as infinity.
2. For each vertex, repeat the following process (|V| - 1) times：For each edge (u, v) with weight w, if the distance to u plus w is less than the distance to v, update the distance to v.
3. After |V| - 1 iterations, check for negative-weight cycles by iterating through all edges again. If a shorter path is found, it indicates the presence of a negative-weight cycle.
### floyd
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
1. Create a distance matrix to store the shortest distance between every pair of vertices, initializing it with the edge weights from the graph. 
2. Iterate through each vertex as an intermediate point and update the distance matrix. For each pair of vertices (i, j), check if a path through an intermediate vertex k offers a shorter path. If so, update the distance matrix with this new shorter path.
3. Repeat the process for all vertices as the intermediate vertex.
### dfs
Depth-First Search starts at a given node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
1. Start at the root node
2. Visit the current node and mark it as visited.
3. Recursively visit each unvisited adjacent node, going as deep as possible along each path.
4. Backtrack when no unvisited adjacent nodes are left, and continue to the next unvisited node.
### bfs
Breadth-First Search (BFS) starts at a given node and explores all of its neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
1. Start at the root node 
2. Visit the current node and mark it as visited.
3. Add all unvisited adjacent nodes to a queue.
4. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, visit it, and mark it as visited.
5. Repeat until the queue is empty.
### 堆
A heap is a special tree-based data structure.There are two types of heaps: min-heaps and max-heaps. In a min-heap, the value of each node is greater than the value of its parent. In a max-heap, the situation is exactly the opposite.
1. **Insertion**: Add a new element to the heap and maintain the heap property by "bubbling up" the element to its correct position.
2. **Deletion**: Remove the root element  and maintain the heap property by "bubbling down" the last element to its correct position.
### 并查集
Union-Find, is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into subsets. It is used to efficiently manage and merge sets.
1. **Find**: Determine which subset a particular element is in.
2. **Union**: Merge two subsets into a single subset.
To improve the efficiency of these operations, two techniques are commonly used:
1. **Path Compression**: During the Find operation, make each node point directly to the root, speeding up future operations.
2. **Union by Rank**: Always attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree to keep the tree as flat as possible.
### 红黑树
A Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree which can ensure that the tree remains balanced, providing efficient operations. 
1. Each node is either red or black.
2. The root node is always black.
3. All leaves are black.
4. Red nodes cannot have red children
5. Every path from a given node to its descendant[dɪˈsendənt] leaves has the same number of black nodes.
These properties ensure that the longest path from the root to a leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path, guaranteeing that the tree remains approximately balanced. 
### AVL 树
An AVL Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. It maintains balance by ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one. 
To maintain this balance, AVL trees perform rotations during insertions and deletions:
1. **Left Rotation**: Applied when a node becomes unbalanced to the right.
2. **Right Rotation**: Applied when a node becomes unbalanced to the left.
3. **Left-Right Rotation**: Applied when a left child becomes unbalanced to the right.
4. **Right-Left Rotation**: Applied when a right child becomes unbalanced to the left.
These rotations help to restore the balance of the tree, ensuring that the height remains logarithmic[ˌlɒɡə'rɪðmɪk] relative to the number of nodes. 
### 哈希表
A hash table is a data structure that provides fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations by using a hash function to map keys,allows for quick access to the data.
When two keys produce the same hash index, a collision occurs. There are two primary methods to handle collisions: 
1. chaining: each bucket points to a linked list of entries that share the same hash index, and new entries are simply added to the list when collisions occur.
2. Open addressing: on the other hand, stores all entries directly in the array. When a collision occurs in open addressing, the algorithm searches for the next empty slot using methods such as linear probing[ˈproʊbɪŋ].
### kmp
The KMP algorithm efficiently finds occurrences of a "pattern" string within a "text" string by avoiding unnecessary comparisons. It does this in two steps:
1. **Preprocessing**: Construct a match table which is called as next array for the pattern, indicating the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix.
2. **Matching**: Use this table to skip unnecessary comparisons during the search, resuming the match from the appropriate position in the pattern.
KMP achieves linear time complexity for the search phase.
### 动态规划
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. 
1. Identify the subproblems and solve each one only once.
2. Store the results of subproblems in a table to avoid redundant calculations.
3. Use these stored results to build up solutions to larger problems.
Two way to implement：
- **Top-Down (Memoization)**: Solve the problem recursively and store the results of subproblems.
- **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**: Solve the smallest subproblems first and use their results to iteratively solve larger subproblems.
Dynamic Programming is efficient for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructur.
### 贪心
A greedy algorithm is a problem-solving method that makes a series of choices, each of which looks the best at the moment. The goal is to find the overall optimal solution.
1. Start with an empty solution.
2. At each step, add the best current choice to the solution.
3. Repeat until the solution is complete or all choices have been considered.
Greedy algorithms are used when a problem has the "greedy-choice property," meaning a locally optimal choice will lead to a globally optimal solution. 
## 计算机网络
### TCP/IP 架构
The TCP/IP model is typically described as a five-layer structure:
1. **Physical Layer**: Handles the physical connection between devices.
2. **Data Link Layer**: Manages node-to-node data transfer and error detection.
3. **Network Layer**: Uses IP to address and route packets between devices.
4. **Transport Layer**: Uses TCP to ensure reliable data transfer and correct packet sequencing.
5. **Application Layer**: Supports application services and end-user processes, like HTTP, FTP, etc.
### TCP 与 UDP
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data between devices on a network. It establishes a connection before data transfer and checks for errors.
UDP is a connectionless protocol that allows for fast and efficient data transmission without guaranteeing delivery, order, or error checking. 
## 操作系统
### 死锁
Deadlock is a situation where two or more processes cannot continue because each one is waiting for the other to release a resource. This happens when four conditions occur at the same time:
1. Each pocket has one ball. To continue, a person must get the ball.
2. The person with the ball always wants more balls.
3. They cannot take the ball from someone else who is holding it.
4. This creates a circular wait condition.
### 信号量
A semaphore[ˈseməˌfɔr] is a synchronization tool used to manage access to shared resources in concurrent programming. It helps prevent conflicts by signaling between processes or threads.
There are two main types of semaphores:
1. **Binary Semaphore**: Also known as a mutex, it has two values, 0 and 1, and ensures mutual exclusion, allowing only one process or thread to access the resource at a time.
2. **Counting Semaphore**: It can have a non-negative integer value and allows multiple processes or threads to access.
Semaphores use two main operations:
- **Wait (P operation)**: Decrements the semaphore value, blocking the process or thread if the value is negative.
- **Signal (V operation)**: Increments the semaphore value, unblocking a waiting process or thread if any.
### 进程与线程
1. **Process**: A process is an independent program in execution that has its own memory space. It includes the program code, its own data, and other resources like file handles. Processes are isolated[ˈaɪsəleɪtɪd] from each other, and communication between them typically requires inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms[ˈmekəˌnɪzəm]. 
2. **Thread**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Threads within the same process share the same memory space and resources but can run independently. This makes threads more lightweight and efficient for parallel tasks compared to processes.
## 编译原理
### 编译器的基本结构
1. **Lexical[ˈleksɪk(ə)l] Analysis**:The source code is converted into a sequence of tokens.
2. **Syntax Analysis**:
    - The tokens are analyzed according to the grammatical[ɡrəˈmætɪkl] rules.
    - A parser builds a syntax tree that represents the grammatical structure of the source code.
3. **Semantic Analysis**:
    - The syntax tree is checked for semantic[sɪˈmæntɪk] errors to ensure the code comply with language's rules.
    - Symbol tables are constructed and the syntax tree is marked with type information.
4. **Intermediate Code Generation**:The syntax tree is translated into an intermediate representation[ˌreprɪzenˈteɪʃ(ə)n] that is easier to optimize and translate into machine code.
5. **Intermediate Code Optimization**:
    - The intermediate code is optimized to improve performance and reduce resource usage.
    - Optimizations can include removing useless code, and optimizing loops.
6. **Target Code Generation**:
    - The optimized intermediate code is translated into machine code for the target architecture.
    - This stage involves allocating registers, selecting instructions, and generating the final executable code. 
The compiler is divided into two main parts: the front end and the back end.
1. **Front End**: The front end includes lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. It reads the source code, converts it into tokens, checks for syntactic and semantic errors, and generates an intermediate representation (IR). This phase ensures the code is correctly written and follows the language's rules.
2. **Back End**: The back end involves intermediate code optimization and target code generation. It takes the IR from the front end, optimizes it for performance, and translates it into machine code for the target architecture. This phase focuses on improving efficiency and generating executable code.
