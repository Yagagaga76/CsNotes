Path Tracing ◼ Path tracing extends distributed ray tracing by stochastically sampling all possible light paths 2024/4/2 Physically Based Rendering - Jie Guo Diffuse Diffuse Mirror Light Parallelization ◼ Ray tracing is inherently parallel, since the rays for one pixel are independent of the rays for other pixels ◼ Can take advantage of modern parallel CPU/GPU/Clusters to significantly accelerate a ray tracer  Threading (e.g., Pthread, OpenMP) distributes rays across cores  Message Passing Interface (MPI) distributes rays across processors on different machines  OptiX/CUDA distributes rays on the GPU 2024/4/2 Physically Based Rendering - Jie Guo Parallelization ◼ Memory coherency helps when distributing rays to various threads/processors  Assign spatially neighboring rays (on the image plane) to the same core/processor  These rays tend to intersect with the same objects in the scene, and thus access the same memory 2024/4/2 Physically Based Rendering - Jie Guo Real Time Ray-Tracing ◼ NVIDIA Optix… 2024/4/2 Physically Based Rendering - Jie Guo","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":""}
